# HugeDataSummarizer
C program to sort and summarize data of various Canadian wildlife species
This was a side project created by me as the final project of my semester.
This works by feeding it a csv or text file containing certain parameters such as species name, quantity, etc
and it provides a detailed summary, sorted according to year, province, taxon, etc.
